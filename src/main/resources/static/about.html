    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Started in the great year of 2023, Nolan's Bike Shop was founded. It was initially
    created to fulfill WGU's D287 class's performance assessment, but now has taken a life of its own. One day Nolan thought
        to himself why design websites when I could just sell bikes? </p>
